# README

To get up and running, assuming you've got the correct Ruby installed (see the `.ruby-version` file), and a valid `database.yml`, should be as simple as `bundle install && rails db:setup`.

To run the test suite, `rails test` is your friend.

The site doesn't have any serious complications; there is no email, no background tier, and no other dependencies like a search service.
